# Bachelor's Thesis: Resource Dispersion in Interaction Networks
Network and data analysis framework for my bachelor's thesis on the Dynamics of Resource Dispersion in Interaction Networks.

`GraphSeries.py` and `TempGraph.py` are the two main code files. The Jupyter notebooks mainly call functions from these two files for data analysis. `Thesis_Fabian_Steuer.pdf` contains the thesis itself.
