# Bachelor's Thesis: Resource Dispersion in Interaction Networks
Network and data analysis framework for my bachelor's thesis on the Dynamics of Resource Dispersion in Interaction Networks. "GraphSeries.py" and "TempGraph.py" are the two main code files, whereas the Jupyter notebooks were mainly used for calling functions from these two files to explore data. "Thesis_Fabian_Steuer.pdf" contains the thesis itself.
