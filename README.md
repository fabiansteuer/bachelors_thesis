# Dynamics of Resource Dispersion in Interaction Networks
Network and data analysis framework for my bachelor's thesis on the Dynamics of Resource Dispersion in Interaction Networks at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization.

`GraphSeries.py` and `TempGraph.py` are the two main code files. The Jupyter notebooks mainly call functions from these two files for data analysis. `Thesis_Fabian_Steuer.pdf` contains the thesis itself.
